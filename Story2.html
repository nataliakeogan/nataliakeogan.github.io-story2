  <h1>The Boulevard of Death by Numbers</h1>
  <h2>Pedestrian deaths on Queens Boulevard and Northern Boulevard in Queens have been strikingly similar for the past 14 years. So why has only Queens Boulevard been fixed?</h2>

Beginning the '90s, Queens Boulevard was dubbed the "Boulevard of Death" by New Yorkers due to increasing pedestrian fatalities. In 2014, Mayor Bill de Blasio implemented his Vision Zero initiative in order to combat traffic deaths on Queens Boulevard. This consisted of redesigning the street by implementing bike lanes, concrete medians and sidewalk extensions, which essentially put an end to the pedestrian slaughter.</p>

<p> Since Vision Zero, no pedestrians have been killed on Queens Boulevard. However, Northern Boulevard, which is now nicknamed "The New Boulevard of Death" has had roughly the same numbers as the notorious Queens Boulevard for the past 10 years with a peak of 6 deaths in 2017. Residents of Jackson Heights, Corona and Elmhurst--communities that span the boulevard with the highest rate pedestrian deaths--have been lobbying the Department of Transportation to finally improve safety on Northern Boulevard by implementing similar structures that now exist on Queens Boulevard. </p>
